# Attention

> Attention is a mechanism that helps the model incorporate context as it’s processing a specific token. Think of the following prompt: “The dog chased the squirrel because it”. For the model to predict what comes after “it,” it needs to know what “it” refers to. Does it refer to the dog or the squirrel? [1]
