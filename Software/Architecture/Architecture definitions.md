# Architecture definitions

> System design... is inherently about **boundaries** - what's in, what's out, what spans, what moves between, and about tradeoffs. It reshapes what is outside, just as it shapes what is inside. Ruth Malan

> In most successful software projects, the expert developers working on that project have a shared understanding of the system design. **This shared understanding is called‘architecture.’** This understanding includes how the system is divided into components and how the components interact through interfaces. These components are usually composed of smaller components, but the architecture only includes the components and interfaces that are understood by all the developers. Ralf Johnson

> So, this makes it hard to tell people how to describe their architecture. **“Tell us what is important.”** Architecture is about the important stuff. Whatever that is. Ralf Johnson

> For years, many smart developers recognized that some parts of their systems were harder to modify than others. That’s why software architecture is defined as the **“parts hard to change later.”** This convenient definition partitioned the things you can modify without much effort from truly difficult changes. Unfortunately, this definition also evolved into a blind spot when thinking about architecture: Developers’ assumption that change is difficult becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Ford, Parson, Kua. Building evolutionary architectures.

[[Big ball of mud]] является примером энтропии, когда отсутствует какая-либо структура и ограничения: все может быть осведомлено и связано со всем.
