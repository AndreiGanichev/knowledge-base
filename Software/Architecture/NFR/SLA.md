## Определение

> These metrics set expectations for clients of the service and allow customers to demand a refund if the SLA is not met.

## Пример

> An SLA may state that the service is considered to be up if it has a median response time of less than 200 ms and a 99th percentile under 1 s (if the response time is longer, it might as well be down), and the service may be required to be up at least 99.9% of the time.
