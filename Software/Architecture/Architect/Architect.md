# Architect

## Задачи архитектора

Согласно [4] архитектор "стоит" на трех ногах:

1. Skill: the foundation for practicing architects. It requires knowledge and the ability to apply it to solve real problems.
1. Impact: the measure of how well an architect applies his or her skill to benefit the company.
1. Leadership: determines whether an architect advances the state of the practice.

### Должен ли архитектор писать код?

> What does a software architect do, and when does he or she do it? First of all, a software architect is a programmer; and continues to be a programmer. Never fall for the lie that suggests that software architects pull back from code to focus on higher-level issues. They do not! ... They do this because they cannot do their jobs properly if they are not experiencing the problems that they are creating for the rest of the programmers. [2]

> When I see an architect like this, the most noticeable part of the work is the intense collaboration. In the morning, the **architect programs with a developer, trying to harvest some common locking code**. In the afternoon, the architect participates in a requirements session, helping explain to the requirements people the technical consequences of some of their ideas in nontechnical terms...In many ways, the most important activity of *Architectus Oryzus* is to **mentor the development team**, to raise their level so that they can take on more complex issues.

> A **guide** is a more experienced and skillful team member who teaches other team members to better fend for themselves yet is always there for the really tricky stuff.[1]

> Knowing how best to respond to change while keeping on your feet will be an essential skill for any software leader. [[Building evolutionary architectures book]]
