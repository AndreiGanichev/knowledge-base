> There is no theoretical reason that anything is hard to change about software. If you pick any one aspect of software then you can make it easy to change, but we don’t know how to make everything easy to change. **Making something easy to change makes the overall system a little more complex**, and making everything easy to change makes the entire system very complex. Complexity is what makes software hard to change. That, and duplication. Ralf Johnson. [Who needs architect](https://martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/whoNeedsArchitect.pdf)

> Decoupling comes with its own costs, both the cost of the decoupling itself and the future costs of unanticipated changes. **The more perfectly a design is adapted to one set of changes, the more likely it is to be blind-sided by novel changes**. Kent Beck [Monolith -> Services: Theory & Practice](https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/monolith-services-theory-practice-617e4546a879)

> If ease of change is a bedrock principle of the arcitecture, then change is no longer difficult. Ford, Parson, Kua. Building evolutionary architectures.

> I don’t think the real problem will be solved by making better techniques for separating aspects. **We don’t know what should be the aspects that need separating, and we don’t know when it is worth separating them and when it is not**. Software is not limited by physics, like buildings are. It is limited by imagination, by design, by organization. Ralf Johnson.
