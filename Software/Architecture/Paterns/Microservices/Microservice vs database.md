# Microservice vs database

> **In some ways, services are similar to databases**: they typically allow clients to submit and query data. However, while databases allow arbitrary queries using the query languages, services expose an application-specific API that only allows inputs and outputs that are predetermined by the business logic (application code) of the service. This restriction provides a degree of [[Encapsulation]]: services can impose fine-grained restrictions on what clients can and cannot do. [[Designing Data-Intensive Applications book]]. Chapter 4.
