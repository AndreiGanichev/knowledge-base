> Service templates are one common solution for ensuring consistency. These are **preconfigured sets of common infrastructure libraries** like service discovery, monitoring, logging, metrics, authentication/authorization, and so on.

> The other type of [[Coupling]], service templates, prevents harmful duplication...each service needs to include monitoring, logging, authentication/authorization, and other “plumbing” capabilities. If left to the responsibility of each service team, ensuring compliance and lifecycle management like upgrades will likely suffer. By defining the appropriate technical architecture coupling points in service templates, an infrastructure team can manage that coupling while freeing individual service teams from worrying about it.
