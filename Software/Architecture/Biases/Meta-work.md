# Meta-work

> Most developers would rather write a framework than use a framework to create something useful: **Meta-work is more interesting than work**. Work is boring, mundane, and repetitive, whereas building new stuff is exciting. We once worked with a client who had once been on the cutting edge of technology. They built their own application server, web framework in Java. A decade later, their best developers worked in full-time maintenance mode, fixing their application server, adding features to their web framework, and other mundane chores. Rather than applying innovation on building better applications, they permanently slaved away on plumbing.

> Architects aren’t immune to the syndrome, which manifests in choosing inappropriate but buzz-worthy architectural styles like microservices.
