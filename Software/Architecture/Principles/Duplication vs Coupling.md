# Duplication vs Coupling

> Microservices form a shared nothing architecture — the goal is to decrease coupling as much as possible. Generally, **duplication is preferable to coupling**. Ford, [[Building evolutionary architectures book]]. Architectural Coupling

> Code duplication is not the issue...DRY was never about code. It’s about knowledge. It’s about cohesion. [DRY is about Knowledge](https://verraes.net/2014/08/dry-is-about-knowledge/)
