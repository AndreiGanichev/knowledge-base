# Information hiding

> The core idea with information hiding is to separate the parts of the code that change frequently from ones that are static. We want the module boundary to be *stable*, and it should hir those parts of the module implementation that we expect to change more often. The idea is that internal changed can be made safely as long as module compatibility is maintined. [1]
