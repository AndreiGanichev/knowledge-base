> The rise of containers via tools like Docker is an example of an unknowable industry shift. However, we can trace the rise of containerization via a series of small, incremental steps. Once upon a time, operating systems, application servers, and other infrastructure were commercial entities, requiring licensing and great expense. Many of the architectures designed in that era focused on efficient use of shared resources. Gradually, Linux became good enough for many enterprises, reducing the monetary cost of operating systems to zero. Next, DevOps practices like automatic machine provisioning via tools like Puppet or Chef made Linux operationally free. Once the ecosystem became free and widely used, consolidation around common portable formats was inevitable; thus, Docker. But containerization couldn’t have happened without all the evolutionary steps leading to that end.
