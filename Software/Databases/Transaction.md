# Transaction

## Откуда пришел термин

> In the early days of business data processing, a write to the database typically corresponded to a commercial transaction taking place: making a sale, placing an order with a supplier, paying an employee’s salary, etc. As databases expanded into areas that didn’t involve money changing hands, the term transaction nevertheless stuck, referring to a **group of reads and writes that form a logical unit**.

## ACID

> A transaction needn’t necessarily have ACID properties. Transaction processing just means allowing clients to make low-latency reads and writes— as **opposed to batch processing jobs**, which only run periodically (for example, once per day).
